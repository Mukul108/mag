                        The Principal felt that it would be more useful to have a 5-year course
                        instead, starting from Class VII. It was better to admit boys at a younger
                        age. The suggestion was unanimously accepted and it was decided that The Principal would draw up a detailed scheme indicating the requirements for
                        admission fees, scholarships, pay-scales of teachers etc.<br>(3) It was further decided that the school should start functioning

                    The aim of the school was to provide an opportunity for the students to shoulder responsibility as they grow up and also excel in games. Towards this end, the students will be given sound academic instruction up to the Higher Secondary level. However, special emphasis will be given to games, sports, and athletics. Scientific training will be imparted by qualified coaches. Modern equipment, sports gear, and facilities will be provided for the purpose.

                    Vocational training will form an integral part of education, and special emphasis will be given to this aspect to enable the students to select their careers after passing out from the school.
                    
                    It is intended that admission in each class should be limited to 100 students, and therefore, accommodation and other facilities are being planned based on that criterion.</p>
